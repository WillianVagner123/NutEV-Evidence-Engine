# NutEV Scientific Dashboard

The NutEV web home is a scientific overview, not the search form.

Legacy operational pages remain available; the redesign is incremental and does not change scientific contracts to simplify UI.

## Dashboard data contract

The dashboard does not hardcode production counts. It reads only existing verified surfaces:

- `/api/health`;
- `/api/articles/status`;
- `/api/radar`;
- `/agent-context/article1/SEARCH_STATE.json`;
- `/agent-context/article1/ARTICLE_SUMMARIES.jsonl`;
- `/agent-context/article1/CONTEXT_MANIFEST.json`.

`ARTICLE_SUMMARIES.jsonl` is intentionally Tier-A-sized and rank-blind. The dashboard must never download the full Workbench corpus simply to render charts.

## Visualizations

The initial overview includes:

- bank/Tier A/routing KPI cards;
- scientific pipeline;
- operational evidence-processing funnel;
- full-text coverage donut;
- extraction-method bars;
- B-NORM/C-STRUCT route summary;
- document-type bars;
- operational-domain bars;
- publication timeline;
- provider operational state;
- formal-search readiness;
- provenance/context metadata.

Charts use semantic HTML/CSS and provide numeric labels. No chart is allowed to imply evidence quality from volume.

## Interactive exploration and URL state

The dashboard has a second, read-only analytical layer over the verified Tier A agent context. It can filter the current view by:

- B-NORM/C-STRUCT route;
- document class;
- operational domain;
- source provider;
- publication year;
- full-text retrieval status.

These filters affect only the local Tier A visualization and are persisted in the dashboard URL so the analytical view can be refreshed or shared. They do not write to the Workbench and do not create scientific decisions.

Drill-down behavior is explicit and limited to target pages that can represent the requested state safely:

- document class and compatible provider/full-text filters -> Corpus Explorer;
- operational domain -> Evidence Explorer;
- B-NORM/C-STRUCT -> Review Routes;
- publication year -> local dashboard filter only until the server-side Corpus API exposes a canonical year filter.

The Corpus Explorer hydrates its existing server-side controls from supported URL parameters before its first API request. Evidence Explorer and Review Routes also hydrate and preserve their selected `domain` or `route` in the URL.

A click on a chart remains navigation/filtering only. Counts never become evidence-strength, eligibility or inclusion signals.

## Visual cross-filter layer

The dashboard also exposes a compact visual-exploration surface built from the same verified `ARTICLE_SUMMARIES.jsonl` payload. It adds no new scientific data source and no alternate state model.

The visual layer shows, for the current local filter state:

- selected document count and share of Tier A;
- provider count;
- publication-year window;
- retrieved + partial full-text coverage;
- an interactive full-text distribution;
- an interactive provider mix;
- B-NORM/C-STRUCT route tiles with overlap shown separately;
- a publication pulse chart.

Clicking these visual controls updates the existing dashboard filters rather than creating a new filter engine. The normal URL-state layer remains authoritative for the view. Clicking the same active value again clears that filter.

All visual controls use native buttons for keyboard interaction, retain numeric labels or accessible text, and collapse responsively on small screens. Percentages are descriptive shares of the current filtered Tier A set; they are not quality, certainty, eligibility or evidence-strength metrics.

## Scientific guardrails

The UI must preserve these boundaries:

- discovery is not a formal systematic-review search;
- Bank tier/rank/score are operational priority, not quality or eligibility;
- route membership is not inclusion;
- full-text retrieval is not eligibility;
- machine review profile is not risk of bias, certainty or recommendation;
- provider gap is not absence of literature;
- PRESS draft is not query approval;
- the frontend cannot authorize GF-10, freeze a query, execute a formal search or emit a PRISMA event;
- evidence excerpts/result bundles remain machine/index artifacts until accepted through the appropriate human scientific workflow.

## Presentation mode

The dashboard includes a presentation view that collapses the sidebar and enlarges the analytical surface. It changes presentation only and never changes data or methodological state.

## Agent context lifecycle

The Hetzner container attempts to rebuild the verified Article 1 agent-context bundle before starting the web service. Failure to refresh the context does not block the web server: analytical pages show a partial/error state instead of using sample data.

The persistent context remains under:

```text
project_output_reference/agent_context/article1/
```

and is exposed through the existing safe static symlink under `/agent-context/article1/`.
