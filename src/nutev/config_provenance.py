"""Config provenance: record exactly which config files produced a run.

The taxonomy/scoring configs are assembled by deep-merging a base JSON with any
sibling ``*_supplement*.json`` layers (see ``nutev.settings.load_json``). That
merge is deterministic, but before this module nothing recorded *which* files —
or which versions of them — actually fed a run, so a citation-grade result could
not be tied back to its exact configuration.

This module enumerates the ordered source files for each config family (through
the same ``resolve_config_sources`` the loader uses, so the two can never
disagree), hashes each one and the merged result, and emits a compact
``config_provenance`` record with a single ``config_digest``. Recording that
digest in the run manifest makes a run reproducible and auditable: the same
inputs and the same digest guarantee the same taxonomy/scoring was applied, and
a changed digest flags that the configuration moved.

Pure provenance — it never changes what ``load_json`` merges.
